I've worked with a diverse set of technologies and packages to build dynamic, secure, and user-friendly web applications. Here's a snapshot of the tools I've integrated into my projects:

 🛠️ Backend & Server
- **Node.js** – My go-to runtime for building scalable server-side logic.
- **Express.js** – Used to structure routes, handle middleware, and manage server responses efficiently.
- **MongoDB** – A flexible NoSQL database that powers my data storage needs.
- **Mongoose** – Helps me model MongoDB data with schemas and validations.

 🔐 Authentication & Security
- **Passport.js** – Handles user authentication with multiple strategies.
  - **Passport Local** – For traditional username/password login.
  - **Passport Facebook** – Enables social login via Facebook.
  - **Passport Google OAuth 2.0** – Adds Google sign-in support.
  - **Passport Local Mongoose** – Simplifies integration with Mongoose models.
- **Express Session** – Manages user sessions across requests.
- **Connect Mongo** – Stores session data directly in MongoDB.
- **Cookie Parser** – Parses cookies for session and user tracking.
- **Dotenv** – Keeps sensitive keys and config variables secure.

 📦 Utilities & Enhancements
- **Connect Flash** – Displays temporary messages (like login errors or success alerts).
- **Joi** – Validates incoming data to keep things clean and secure.
- **Multer** – Handles file uploads, especially useful for images.
- **Cloudinary** – Stores and serves uploaded images with transformations.

 🌍 Frontend & UI
- **EJS** – Renders dynamic templates with embedded JavaScript.
- **Mapbox** – Adds interactive maps and geolocation features to my apps.
